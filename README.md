This is the first Mod I ever coded myself. So please don't be angry if something does not work..

The License is MIT-License, so I think you can download, fork, modify and distribute it. But please, don't redistribute the mod and if you modify it and upload it, tell the world that it was me who "helped" you..

The most Libraries are automatically configured. Those are:
  * CodeChickenLib

  * JEI
